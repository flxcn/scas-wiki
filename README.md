## Welcome to the MA Small Claims Wiki
The Small Claims Advisory Service is the only organization in Massachusetts that focuses primarily on helping individuals navigate the small claims court system in the Commonwealth. Our mission is to empower socioeconomically disadvantaged people in order for them to seek legal redress effectively through the small claims system, and to protect their rights as consumers, tenants, and members of our community. Often, these individuals are unaware oftheir options without our help. Through telephone communication and appointments, we provide citizens with information on Massachusetts law, small claims procedure, and effective court presentations.
